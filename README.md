# Rgit Faculty Dashboard — Online Attendance Management System

An online attendance management system built to make faculty attendance tracking **faster, cleaner, and less painful** (no more sorting roll numbers for half your life). The dashboard provides a simple UI for managing classes and attendance records using a modern Bootstrap admin template. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

## ✨ Why this exists
Online attendance becomes messy when you have to:
- manually sort students by roll number,
- maintain consistent records across sessions,
- and spend more time on admin than teaching.

So we built a lightweight dashboard to simplify attendance management for faculty. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

## ✅ Features
- Faculty dashboard UI (responsive admin layout)
- Login + Forgot Password screens (UI)
- Pages for managing classes (ex: “Add Class”, “My Class”)
- Tables view for structured records
- Clean Bootstrap styling + FontAwesome icons

> Note: This repo currently includes the **frontend/dashboard** and UI flows. Backend/database integration (if any) can be plugged in separately.
